# Mysterious Enciphering Application

Provided with the encrypting program, can you find a way to obtain the flag?

The key will be obfuscated, so some more reverse engineering is required then running "strings main.exe". 

You can either choose to attempt to call the decrypting function or maybe the encrypting message isn't as secure as they believe it is... (Brute force technique is in ./scripts)
